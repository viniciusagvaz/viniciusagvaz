# Hello, World!👋

Call me **Vini**, chief 🫡
Formerly a chef who's now a programming student. I come from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 😎🩴

Studying via the web and a course in Senac - RJ!

I'm learning HTML/CSS/Js at the moment, but have big hopes to one day maybe become a gamer dev.
I have little to no experience programming games but hey why not pursue an old dream, am I right?! 

I am almost (emphasis on **almost** as **not really, but...**) fluent in English, so if you want to teach and help someone in need, I'm your guy!😁

Peace out fellas!✌🏻👽
